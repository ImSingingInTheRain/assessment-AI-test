# ðŸŽˆ Blank app template

A simple Streamlit app template for you to modify!

[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://blank-app-template.streamlit.app/)

### How to run it on your own machine

1. Install the requirements

   ```
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the app

   ```
   $ streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

### Configuring Streamlit Cloud secrets

When deploying on Streamlit Cloud, define the following entries in the **Secrets** manager:

```toml
[github]
token = "<your-personal-access-token>"
repo = "<owner>/<repository>"
branch = "<branch-name>"  # optional, defaults to "main"
path = "<path/to/file.json>"  # optional, defaults to "form_schema.json"

editor_password_hash = "<sha256-hex-digest>"
```

- **`github.token`** â€” A GitHub personal access token with the `repo:contents` and `pull_request` scopes so the app can read the form schema and open pull requests with updates.
- **`github.repo`**, **`github.branch`**, **`github.path`** â€” Identify the repository, branch, and file that hold the schema the app reads from (and writes back to). Only `repo` is required; the other keys fall back to sensible defaults when omitted.
- **`editor_password_hash`** â€” The SHA-256 hash of the password required to edit content inside the app.

For backwards compatibility the application also understands the previous flat keys (`github_token`, `github_repo`, `github_branch`, `github_file_path`, and `github_api_url`). Streamlit Cloud merges entries defined at the top level with nested sections, so you can continue using the older naming convention if you already have it saved.

Generate the password hash with a one-liner such as:

```bash
python -c "import hashlib; print(hashlib.sha256('your-password'.encode()).hexdigest())"
```

For public repositories, the app can read file contents using a token that only has `repo:contents` (even unauthenticated reads are possible for fully public data). Private repositories always require a token; ensure the PAT you provide includes the listed scopes so the app can fetch contents and submit pull requests securely.
